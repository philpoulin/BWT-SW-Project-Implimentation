# BWT-SW-Project-Implimentation

This projects demo's what a BWT-SW alignment algorithm does.  The project takes a sequence and performs a BWT transformation.
Then the BWT is used to perform an optimized SW local alignment using a suffix trie.
The next step is to optimize space efficiency by implimenting a wavelet tree on the BWT count data.
